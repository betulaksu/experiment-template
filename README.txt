Summary:

This is our template for writing experiments in HTML/JavaScript/CSS to post as external HITs on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Together with Submiterator (https://github.com/danlassiter/Submiterator/) and mmturkey (https://github.com/longouyang/mmturkey), it provides a full workflow for simple, flexible online surveys. It is not functional as-is: you have to know enough HTML and JavaScript to add content to it, using the hints provided in the comments. If you know the basics of these and a little bit about JQuery, you should be ready to go.  

If you know some JavaScript but no JQuery, this great free interactive course at CodeSchool (http://try.jquery.com/) will tell you what you need to know to get going and a bit more. For graphics, there are lots of options; I like Raphael.js, and have included in the HTML comments a few lines that can be used if you want to use this for graphics.

The Template’s sister tool, Submiterator, can be found at

For inspiration, or if you want to modify code instead of starting from scratch, here are a few examples of experiments that have been written and run using the Template-Submiterator-mmturkey workflow:

	A simple text-based reasoning experiment (see Lassiter & Goodman 2012 in CogSci Proceedings):

	An example making use of Raphael.js for graphics (see Nadathur & Lassiter forthcoming in Sinn und Bedeutung 2014 proceedings):

If you have questions or comments on Submiterator and associated documentation, please contact me at the address at top of this file.

Happy experimenting!
